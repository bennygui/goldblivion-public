This is the implementation of GOLDblivion for BGA:
https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=goldblivion

This is a copy of the original private repository, stripped of images to
prevent any copyright problems. I will try to update it when the main
repository changes.

This is my fifth game on BGA. It uses BX, my general library that
I reuse in all my games.

This matches version 240329-1526 on BGA.
